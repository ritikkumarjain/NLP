With the rise of social media in recent years, it has become a valuable research tool for people's opinions on a variety of topics. When it comes to climate change, there are a few concerns to consider.
- What are people doing to cope with extreme weather and climate change?
- Is it possible that people adapt without even realizing it?

The study's significance was to learn how Natural Language Processing methodologies could be used to assess user sentiments in response to extreme weather events.

Through this study we tested the usability of a popular social media tool i.e., Twitter as a possible disaster response tool.
